The first line of a map file is the map name, up to 31 characters.

Each following line starts either with the name of a named room, or the integer ID of a corridor.
Following the name or ID, semicolon-separated room names and corridor IDs denote connected rooms
and corridors. A room can have at most 8 connections and one ladder connection. To denote a ladder
connection, start the connection with a "%". Only one ladder definition is required.

Each line of the input file may be up to 255 characters long.

A given map may have a total of 64 rooms and corridors.

The xenomorph's starting location is denoted by prepending "&" to the room name;

The player's starting location is denoted by prepending "*" to the room name;

Ash's starting location is denoted by prepending "$" to the room name.

Each of the special locations listed above MUST be named rooms.

After the room and corridor listings, three tildes denote the start of Scrap, Event, and Coolant
rooms. The first line contains a semicolon-delimited list of rooms that start out with Scrap,
the second with Events, the third with Coolant. There can be at most 8 of each of these rooms.

After the scrap, event, and coolant listings, three tildes denote the start of a visual ASCII map. Another
three tildes denote the end. The ASCII map may be up to 2kb in size. The ASCII map is optional.
